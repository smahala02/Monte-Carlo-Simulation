# Monte Carlo Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed tutorial on Monte Carlo Simulation, a computational technique that utilizes random sampling to obtain numerical results. The **Jupyter Notebook** in this repository explains the basic concepts, the process of simulation, and provides real-world examples to help you understand the technique.

Monte Carlo simulations are widely used in areas such as finance, engineering, physics, and risk assessment, allowing for predictions and analysis based on probabilistic models.

## Contents
1. `Monte Carlo Simulation.ipynb` – The Jupyter Notebook containing the tutorial and example code.
2. `README.md` – Information about the repository and how to use it.

## Navigation
The following sections are covered in the Jupyter Notebook:

- **Introduction to Monte Carlo Simulation**: Brief overview of what Monte Carlo Simulation is and where it is applied.
- **Random Sampling**: Explanation of how random sampling is used in Monte Carlo methods.
- **Basic Simulation Example**: A step-by-step example demonstrating a simple Monte Carlo simulation.
- **Advanced Simulation Example**: A more complex simulation with applications to real-world scenarios.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and plots that illustrate the results of the simulations.
